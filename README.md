Proof of concept of integration between Alexa and Google Maps.
<br/><br/>
A server in node.js running on an AWS EC2 instance processes the declarations from Alexa and sends commands via web socket to an HTML page that shows in Google Maps a place (for example, a recommended restaurant) and the route from the hotel to that place. 
<br/><br/>
It shows photos, allows to make a reservation and also can show videos (YouTube API).
